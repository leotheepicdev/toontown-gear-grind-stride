Leo's Toontown source release notes.
Based on Stride

V1.0.0 - The General Update
------

General
- Removed Easy Promotion Papers from Toontown Stride
- A new holiday has been added into Toontown. Fun Friday! Every Friday, Gag XP is double! If an invasion is present, Gag XP is triple!
- Got school and can't grind your merits? Don't worry, a new holiday has been added into Toontown! Merit Monday! Every Monday, the Merit multiplier is doubled!
- Merit Toontasks now exist. Completing them will reward you with 20% of your max merits. Note that you can only get Merit Toontask once done the taskline. Use this reward wisely.
  These Toontasks will be removed while searching for ToonTasks once you max your Cog Disguise.
- Add random cog invasion logic.
- Along with random cog invasion login, added Mega Invasion logic. When a mega invasion holiday is active, the cogs that invade with the holiday, have a 40% of spawning per random invasion spawn.
  These invasions last longer than a typical invasion. Tax Day has Number Crunchers. Black Cat Day has Bloodsuckers. Valentoons Day has The Minglers. Ides of March has Backstabbers.
- Executive Cogs have invaded Toontown! They have a chance of spawning in streets and random invasions. Their attack damage is 1.5x with damage rounding up if the damage ends up being a decimal. 
  Executive Cogs also have a higher chance than regular cogs to dodge Gags. Expect more work to be done with these cogs.
- Cheesy Effects have been reworked. Now you can buy them from an npc and store them forever.
- Removed Code Redemption
- Virtual Cog Update
 - 4 varieties. ATK(Red), HP(Green), DEF(Blue), ACC(Pink)
 - ATK does double damage. HP has double HP. DEF dodges gag attacks more. ACC hits no matter what.
 - Virtual cogs have a 10% chance of spawning in LawbotHQ and Lawbot Cog Buildings.
 - They now provide Gag experience.
 Context: Current virtual cogs just felt bland. We wanted to make them come in colors. Our goal with this update was to keep them rare,
          but make them more punishing.
- All cog tiers now go up another 3 levels!
- 6 and 7 story cog buildings have been implemented into Toontown!
- Implement "Doodles Power Up" SOS card. This will last 2 rounds and allow doodles to hit and heal triple of their normal amount.
 
Toontown Tweaks
- Skelecogs now always pick random toons.
- Sellbot HQ factory has been made more difficult. Cogs are as difficult as TTO's old factory, Goons deal more damage, Stompers deal more damage, and Lava deals more damage. Added 3 skelecogs to Lava Room Foyer.
- VP has received damage buffs in the pie round.
- VP battle rounds have been made harder.
- Pencil Pusher's Fill With Lead attack has received a damage buff and slight accuracy buff to truly show it's a signature attack.
- Yesman has received a damage and accuracy buff.
- Micromanager's Brainstorm attack has received a accuracy buff.
- Tweaked Glad Hander damage.
- Tweaked The Big Cheese, Loan Shark, Robber Baron cog attacks.
- Visually improve Fill With Lead and Fountain Pen
- Experience cap has been increased from 300 to 500.
- More than one toon may now be at the same gag clerk.
- Reimplemented Whisper from Toontown Online which tells you a building you saved has been taken over.
- V2.0 Cogs will now have their version highlighted in red.
- A new cog attack named Song and Dance has been added. Song and Dance is a group attack that is on Mr. Hollywood and The Big Cheese.
- Added backface culling for Cogs and Boss heads.
- Added smooth animations
- Removed blue background from shtiker book and instead show the area you are in but darken it.
- Tweak ToonTask posters
- Removed Clerk Clara tutorial movie.
- Chat will no longer send when it overflows. Messages containing only whitespace will not send anymore.
- Cog disguises have been upgraded! Toons have figured out how to obtain Cog heads and their voices! Those Cogs will never know the difference now!
- Added a "Withdraw All" button to Bank GUI in estates!
- Rebalanced Sound. Opera damage has gone from 90 to 75. Foghorn carry limit has gone from 3 to 2. Trunk and Aoogah damage slightly increased. Nerfed experience required to max Sound.
 Context: Higher leveled sound felt overpowered, while lower leveled sound felt underwhelming. We wanted to make Foghorn use more punishing while allowing lower sound to still be useful.
- Trap damage has been buffed.
- Increased Battle Timer to 25 seconds

Bug Fixes

- Fixed Cogs Miss and Toons Hit SOS movies.
