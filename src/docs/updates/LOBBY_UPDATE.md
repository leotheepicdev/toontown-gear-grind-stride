# Boss Lobby Update
This document relates to the Lobby update.

# Plans
* Lobbys are now server-wide meaning toons from different districts can be in one lobby. 
* Toons can make their own public/private lobbys if they'd like.

# Note
Bosses would likely need to receive some work too considering there are multiple AI servers.
